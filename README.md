Territory-Based Running and Fitness Tracking Application
A gamified running and fitness tracking application where users capture geographic territories through running activities.

Features
GPS-based running tracker with route visualization
Territory capture when completing a closed running loop
Map display showing owned territories
Territory challenge/takeover functionality
Leaderboard based on captured area or distance
Running statistics (time, calories, distance)
Activity history tracking
JWT-based authentication system
Technology Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Frontend: EJS, Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap
Database: MongoDB
Geo Processing: Turf.js
Authentication: JWT
Deploy Full App (Login + API + Database)
If you want /login, /signup, and all /api/* routes to work online, deploy this as a Node.js server (not GitHub Pages).

Recommended: Render (with MongoDB)
This repository now includes render.yaml for Blueprint deployment.

Push code to your GitHub repo (HishamXS420/Territory-Runner)
In Render dashboard, click New + → Blueprint
Select this repository and deploy
After first deploy, open Render Shell for the web service and run:
node init-db.js
Open your live URL:
https://<your-service>.onrender.com/login
https://<your-service>.onrender.com/signup
https://<your-service>.onrender.com/
Important Notes
GitHub Pages only serves static files, so it cannot run this Express + MongoDB app.
Use init-db.js in hosted environments to create tables only.
Avoid setup-db.js in production, because it drops and recreates the database.

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
MongoDB (v12 or higher)
Git
1. Clone and Setup
cd "d:\Study\4.1\Attachment\Territory App\Test4"
npm install
2. Database Setup
Option A: Using MongoDB Command Line

# Connect to MongoDB
psql -U mongodb

# Create database
CREATE DATABASE territory_running_app;

# Connect to the new database
\c territory_running_app

# Run the schema setup
\i config/database.sql
Option B: Using Node.js Script (Coming soon)

3. Configure Environment Variables
Edit .env file and set your configuration:

PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=territory_running_app
DB_USER=mongodb
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_change_in_production
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# Application URL
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
4. Install Dependencies
npm install
5. Start the Server
# Development mode (with nodemon)
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
Server will be running at: http://localhost:3000

Usage
Starting a Run
Click "Start Running" on the home page
The app will request GPS permission
Map will center on current location
Run your route and complete a closed loop
Click "Finish" to end the session
If valid closed loop detected, territory is captured
Viewing Territories
All territories are displayed on the map as colored polygons
Markers at center of each territory show owner username
Home page shows recent running sessions
Checking Leaderboard
View top runners by territory area or distance
See your current rank based on criteria
Technical Details
Closed Loop Detection
A running route is considered a closed loop when:

The distance between the start point and end point is ≤ 50 meters
At least 2 coordinate points are recorded
Area Calculation
Uses Turf.js for polygon area calculation
Polygon is created from running coordinates
Area stored in square meters
Distance Calculation
Uses Haversine formula for geographic distance calculation
Accumulates distance between all consecutive coordinate points
Result stored in kilometers
Calorie Estimation
Formula: distance (km) × weight (kg) × 0.63
Assumes average user weight of 70 kg
Adjusted based on running speed and terrain
Integration Notes
This application integrates with existing login/signup pages. The pages are implemented using:

EJS templates for rendering
Client-side JWT token storage in localStorage
Token-based API authentication
Login and signup pages should:

Store JWT token in localStorage
Redirect authenticated users to home page
Handle token validation and refresh
Future Enhancements
 Territory conflict handling with automatic boundary adjustment
 Google/Apple login integration
 Real-time territory challenges
 Social features (friends, competitions)
 Advanced statistics and analytics
 Mobile app development
 Offline mode support
 Territory trading/purchasing
Troubleshooting
Database Connection Issues
Check .env file settings and ensure MongoDB service is running.

GPS Not Working
Check browser's location permission settings
Ensure HTTPS is used in production
Some browsers require user interaction to enable geolocation
Map Not Displaying
Verify Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap CDN links are loading
Check browser console for errors
Ensure map container has proper CSS styling
Support
For issues or questions, please refer to the documentation or contact the development team.
